## Project Title
**Decentralized KYC (Know Your Customer) System** - Implement a system for verifying identities using blockchain.

## Project Description
A blockchain-based KYC system that ensures secure identity verification while maintaining user privacy.


## Project Vision
The goal of this project is to build a decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving **KYC system**.  
It will enable individuals to verify their identities once and securely share their credentials with businesses **without exposing sensitive data**.  

By leveraging blockchain, we aim to **eliminate redundant KYC processes**, reduce identity fraud, and provide businesses with verified user identities **without relying on centralized authorities**.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with Verifiable Credentials**: Using **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** to allow self-sovereign identity.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Users can prove their identity **without revealing personal information**.
- **Cross-Blockchain Compatibility**: Expanding the system to work across multiple blockchains.
- **AI-powered Fraud Detection**: Implementing AI to detect fraudulent identity submissions.

## Key Features
- **Blockchain Security**: Immutable identity verification records stored on-chain.
- **User-Controlled Privacy**: Users decide who gets access to their KYC data.
- **One-Time Verification**: Businesses can access verified users without re-verification.
- **Smart Contracts for Compliance**: Automates access and verification processes.
- **Reduces Identity Theft**: Eliminates data breaches caused by centralized KYC databases.
